I always order the mixed sauce cheese burst pasta because that's the best according to me obviously! But if you are someone who's vegetarian and want to have pasta do visit this place. Apart from the pasta o would suggest they change their cheese fries as it's not melted cheese they just grate it on the fries which really doesn't work, so I would suggest then to try and send the

Now you will ask me who gave you right to speak about Sadashiv peth attitude...becoz i myself is a resident of Sadashiv Peth...\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude03. If you are on Laxmi Road and you feel hungry this is atleast a one time visit restaurant. They serve South Indian and Maharashtrian delicacies and that too authentic maharashtrian. Their menu ranges from Dosa, Idli and Uthappa too Misal, Sabudana items and Kothambir wadis. They also serve specialised food for people who are fasting but i believe they serve it on fixed days of the week.  The quality of the food is definitely good and they serve in steel plates (another good thing which i like). This is a typical self service kind of restaurant, but the advantage is self service restro are mostly those places where footfall is more and hence they serve fresh food every time.  They have limited seating area and almost no parking space even for a two wheeler, common parking is available out side at khumthekar road so if you are lucky you would get it.  Their misal is really good and their taste of sambhar is good. Their portion size is i believe is little on a lesser side. Their staff attitude might look little harsh but thats how it is in Sadashiv peth. The ambience and the people and the overall feel would definitely take you to a old golden era in Pune. Overall a must visit place atleast once.","id":39131407,"rating_color":"5BA829","review_time_friendly":"Sep 19, 2018","rating_text":"Great!","timestamp":1537298990,"likes":1,"user":{"name":"Diganth

So after having a spicy misal when we went for the Mastani, it was crowded with no empty chairs and this is when we saw the most ignored Kondhalkar Mastani House. So how was our experience, let's see..  \u3010FOOD ORDERED\u3011\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f \u25c6Mango Mastani Surprisingly, it tasted at par with Sujata Mango Mastani if not better. Loved it.  \u25c6Pista Mastani This one was also very good.  \u3010AMBIENCE\u3011\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f With just three limited tables, though it was not enough seating but was definitely better than sitting or standing outside while having your Mastani.  \u3010VALUE FOR MONEY\u3011\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f Pretty decently priced. Two full Mastanis were for Rs. 170.  \u3010OVERALL EXPERIENCE\u3011\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f While I am a die hard fan of Sujata Mastani, but if I have an option to stand outside and eat or sit inside and enjoy my Mastani under the cool breeze of fan.

Nice flavor of Methi and prepared with generous oil.  Chutney **** The chutney served with Paratha though watery was too good. Hint of khatta meetha taste.  Gulab Jamun ** Didn't expect much from this sweet.
